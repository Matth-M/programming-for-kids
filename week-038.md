## [DAY-260] strings

Write (in notepad), run (from cmd) and explain(on paper) the following code:
```
def encrypt(s):
    r = ''

    for character in s:
        ascii = ord(character)
        r += 'z' * ascii
        r += ' '

    return r


def decrypt(s):
    r = ''
    ascii = 0

    for character in s:
        if character == 'z':
            ascii += 1
        else:
            r += chr(ascii)
            ascii = 0

    return r



encrypted = encrypt('hello world')
print(encrypted)
print(decrypt(encrypted))
```

## [DAY-261] lists

Find and fix the bug in the following program:

```
# [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3] should become [8, 2, 1, 3]
def rle(x):
  r = []
  for v in x:
    if len(r) == 0 or r[-1] != v:
      r.append(0)
      r.append(v)
    if v == r[-1]:
      r[-2] += 1
  return r

# [8, 2, 1, 3] should become [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3]
def rld(x):
  r = []

  for i in range(0, len(x), 2):
    for k in range(x[i]):
      r.append(x[i+1])

  return r


a = rle([1,1,1,1,1,1,1])
print(a)
b = rld(a)
print(b)
```

> Spend some time stepping through or print debugging, I chose to use print debugging to emphasize on "what should this code do, and how do you make sure it does what it says", but I think proper debugging can be introduced at this point, in the same time I dont want to introduce new concepts yet. Learning programming takes time, you can not rush it.


## [DAY-262] lists

Find and fix the bug in the following program (using only notepad and cmd):

```
def avg(x):
    n = 0
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, len(x)):
        sum += x[i]
        n += 1

    return sum / n


print(avg([7,3,5]))
```


## [DAY-263] lists

find the bug in the following code (using notepad and cmd):


```
def uniq(data):
    result = []
    for inputNumber in data:
        seen = False
        for resultNumber in result:
            if inputNumber != resultNumber:
                seen = True
        if not seen:
            result.append(inputNumber)

    return result

# should print [1,2,3]
print(uniq([1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]))
```


## [DAY-264] design

Today we will do a basic design and 3d print it, first make an account on https://www.tinkercad.com/ and then build something there (use W to attach workarea to a surface so you can easilly put one thing on top or on the side of another).

Grab a masuring tool and get any object that you see and measure it and build it inside tinkercad.

> She did some great designs, but they are somewhat personal and I wont show them in the book. Also she was the one who found out about the W key doing temporary workarea, which makes the whole tinkercad propgram 10000 times better, and before this I was doing designs super slow and was very annoyed :)

## [DAY-265] c; if

Examine the following program, type it in notepad and compile it with gcc, then examine the output binary.

```
// comments in C
// save the file as hello.c
// use gcc -o hello hello.c to compile the program
#include <stdio.h>

int fizzbuzz(int n) {
	int fizbuzzes = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
			printf("fizzbuzz\n");
			fizbuzzes += 1;
		} else if (i % 3 == 0) {
			printf("fizz\n");
		} else if (i % 5 == 0) {
			printf("buzz\n");
		} else {
			printf("%d\n", i);
		}
	}
	return fizbuzzes;
}

int main(void) {
	while(1) {
		printf("hello, press q to stop\n");
		char c = getchar();
		getchar();
		if (c == 81 || c == 113) {
			break;

	}
	return 0;
}
```


## [DAY-266] lists

Maka e program to add a bunch of inputs to a list and pick a random item from it:

> thats what she wrote, I explained about the random.seed

```
import random
import time
random.seed(time.time())
a = ["Rumble","Fortnite","Call of Duty","Bedwars"]
print(a)
while True:
    b= input('add anything you want: ')
    if b == "quit":
        break
    a.append(b)

print("this is what you got in here: ",a)
print(random.choice(a))
```

## [DAY-267] lists

Make a program to sum a list of lists of numbers `x = [[1,2,3],[1,4],[6]]`

```
def sum(list_of_lists):
    s = 0
    for l in list_of_lists:
        for element in l:
            s += element
    return s
```

make a program to return a copy of the list without the first and last element (using `pop()`)

```
def middle(x):
    copy = []
    for e in x:
        copy.append(e)

    copy.pop(len(x)-1)
    if len(copy) > 0:
        copy.pop(0)

    return e
```

		print("fizzzz buzz")
	elif i%3==0:
		print("buxx")
	elif i %5==0:
		print("fizzzz")
	else:
		print(i)
```

add all the non fizz,buzz,fizbuzz numbers to a list and print it

```

## [DAY-270] fizzbuzz; c

Count the amount of fizzes, buzzes, numbers and fizzbuzzes, and also ask the user to enter the number for how many numbers to check.

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int i;

  int fizzbuzzes;
  int fizzes;
  int buzzes;
  int numbers;
  int how_many;

  fizzbuzzes = 0;
  fizzes = 0;
  buzzes = 0;
  numbers = 0;

  printf("how many do you want: ");
  scanf("%d", &how_many);

  for (i = 0; i < how_many; i++) {
    if (i % 5 == 0 && i % 3 == 0) {
      fizzbuzzes++;
    } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
      fizzes++;
    } else if (i % 5==0){
      buzzes++;
    } else {
      numbers++;
    }
  }

  printf("total: %d, fizzes: %d, buzzes: %d, fizzbuzzes: %d, numbers: %d\n", how_many, fizzes, buzzes,fizzbuzzes, numbers);

}

```

> explain initialization of variables, and printf parameters, also focus on how scanf gets a pointer to the how_many variable



## [DAY-271] fizzbuzz; c

Write fizbuzz on your own starting with the following code:

```
#include <stdio.h>


int main(void) {
  int how_many;

  printf("how many do you want: ");
  scanf("%d", &how_many);

  ....
  ....
  ....
  ....


  return 0;
}
```


## [DAY-272] fizzbuzz; c

Print how many fuzzes, buzzes, fizbuzzes and numbers you are printing.

> thats what she wrote:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int how_many;
  int counternum = 0;
  int fizzbuzz = 0;
  int buzz = 0;
  int fizzz = 0;

  printf("how many do you want: ");
  scanf("%d", &how_many);

  for (int a = 0; a < how_many; a++) {
    if (a % 15 == 0) {
      printf("FIZZBUZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\n");
      fizzbuzz++;
    } else if (a % 5 == 0) {
      printf("FIZZzzz\n");
      fizzz++;
    } else if (a % 3 == 0) {
      printf("BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\n");
      buzz++;
    } else {
      printf("%d\n", a);
      counternum++;
    }
  }
  printf("%d %d %d %d\n", counternum, fizzbuzz, buzz, fizzz);
  return 0;
}
```

> change the ints to `unsigned char` and then to `unsigned short` and discuss integer overflow


## [DAY-273] fizzbuzz; c; struct

You can group a bunch of variables together in a custom type. In the fizzbuzz case, you might want to group all the counters together:

```
struct counter {
  int numbers;
  int fizzbuzz;
  int fizz;
  int buzz;
};

```

This is how we would use it, we would define the struct type `counter`, and then we will make a function that counts them and returns a counter value:

```
#include <stdio.h>

struct counter {
  int numbers;
  int fizzbuzz;
  int fizz;
  int buzz;
};

struct counter fizzy(int n) {
  struct counter ret = {0};

  for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
    if (a % 15 == 0) {
      ret.fizzbuzz++;
    } else if (a % 5 == 0) {
      ret.fizz++;
    } else if (a % 3 == 0) {
      ret.buzz++;
    } else {
      ret.numbers++;
    }
  }

  return ret;
}

int main(void) {
  int how_many;

  printf("how many do you want: ");
  scanf("%d", &how_many);

  struct counter f = fizzy(how_many);
  printf("%d %d %d %d\n", f.numbers, f.fizzbuzz, f.buzz, f.fizz);

  return 0;
}

```

You can see that you can access the inner methods of the struct using `.` (dot), by saying `ret.fizzbuzz = 6' it gets translated to put 6 where the member fizzbuzz is in the block of memory used by the `ret` structure.


Lets say you want to build a chess game, you might want to have a struct for the piece, for example:

```
struct chess_piece {
    uint8_t kind; // what kind of piece it is, 0: pawn, 1: bishop ...
    uint8_t x;    // board column
    uint8_t y;    // board row
    int used;     // how many time the piece was used
};

```

Or you are making a platformer game, you might want to have a struct for the player:

```
struct player {
    unsigned short health;
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

You can also embed structs in structs:

```
struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct player {
    unsigned short health; // health points left, 0 means game over
    struct point pos; // player's position
};
```


For now we will just do basics with structs to get used with them. How to pass them around in our program, giving them as parameters to functions, or returning them, or having poitners to them.
