## [DAY-355] riscv assembler

Tle last month or so we spent learning RISCV assembler while making a board game: [PROJEKT:OVERFLOW](https://punkx.org/overflow/)

Each day I made an exercise and then we wrote (either together or her own) the execution of the program, you can see most of the examples at https://punkx.org/overflow/#assembly

I am attaching the photos of some of the work just for the record:
