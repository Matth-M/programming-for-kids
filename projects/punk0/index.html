    <h2>PUNK0 - A FUNCTION COMPOSITION CARD GAME</h2>

    Each card's <font color="red">output</font> is another card's <font color="red">input</font>. <br>

    Each card has a function on it, each function is written in 4 languages: c, go, python, go, js. The game starts with the list <mark>[0, 0, 0, 0]</mark>. You must play either the same function in a different language, or any function in the same language as the previous card. Each card takes a list and return a list, and there are <b>punk0, punk1, punk2, punk3</b> cards that print what you should do depending on the appropriate index of the list. For example if the list gets to <mark>[0, -2, 1, 3]</mark> and you play <b>punk1(x)</b>, which operates on index 1 of the list, in this case having value -2, you must play 2 more valid cards, or draw from the deck.<br><br>


    I worked on this game mainly to teach my daughter that knowing many languages is not very important, what you need to know is how things work, also what they represent, and especially, how the computer sees them. Also to start building intuition about rotating and manipulating pieces of memory. If you are a parent teaching your kid, and is exploring more tools to help you, I made few other card games:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://punkjazz.org/programming-time/">programming time</a>, which is a game to teach python and some more fundamental algorithms, from hash tables to RSA</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/c-pointer-game/">The C Pointer Game - Pointers, Arrays and Strings</a>, a game to teach kids to look at the computer memory and understand references and values</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/4917/">4917</a>, a game to teach kids machine code and how the cpu works with memory and registers</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jackdoe/programming-for-kids/blob/master/book.md">programming for kids</a>, a log of my journey of teaching my daughter how to code</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/">The Unix Pipes Game</a>, a game to teach kids to use basic UNIX commands: <code>cat, sort, grep, head, tail, wc, uniq</code></li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/ext-0.1">The Unix Pipes Game - Process Substitution</a>, an expansion of the unix pipes game to teach process substition and also: <code>paste, tr, cut, bc</code></li>
    </ul>

    This is how example round looks:

    Symbols and Colors:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The demons on the cover represent the 4 languages, C being the skull, go is the mask, and the two fishes are js and python. I think its funny how everything we do circles around C, the further you move away (pytorch for example) the harder it pulls you in. Some day maybe we will get enough escape velocity and build new paradigms that are not just C with some suggar.</li>
      <li>the celtic patter on the back of the box represents how everything in CS is connected, and knowledge and understanding can be built in many ways (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zesyeIvbjLQ">Richard Feynman - The Relation of Mathematics to Physics</a>)</li>
      <li>the colors of the cards:<ul>
          <li><b>c</b>: I tried to go for old school <a href='https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-c/30'>Borland C++ 3.1 for DOS</a> look, which is very close to my heart, I think it was possibly the best IDE I have ever used.</li>
          <li><b>go</b>: I used <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)'>ACME</a>'s colors, but added a bit of color for the keywords. Even though I dont use syntax highlighting, I think people will find it weird to have zero colors in code.</li>
          <li><b>js</b>: inspired by hackerrank's dark theme.</li>
          <li><b>py</b>: inspired by github's light theme.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    This is possibly the 30th version of the game, and its really fun (I think), we printed and tried many versions and I want to thank my friends who helped me test it: ronen, peter, maarten, angel, mattias, deo, evanji, melore, and many others who I annoyed with playing the more boring versions :D

    PS: No LLM was used for the cards, but I did use some ChatGPT to help me rephrase the rules, since english is not my native language and I do struggle with expressing my ideas especially when the space is so limited.
