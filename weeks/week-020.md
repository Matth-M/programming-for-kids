## [DAY-136] For; Arrays; Memory

Lets make a super simple C program

Just to get familiar witht he syntax, it does not use indentation to group code, but {}, and also each variable has to have known type (size), e.g we have to tell the C compiler (compiler is a program that takes the text code and transforms it into machine code) that  `i` is of type `int` which on our computer is exactly 4 bytes long.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += 10;
    }

    printf("%d\n", sum);
}
```

When you execute `gcc -o foo foo.c` (if you save the program in foo.c), it will make the binary `foo`, do `cat foo` to see the actual binary made from the compiler. If you run `objdump -D foo` you will see the assembly code and the machine code corresponding to it.

`cat foo`:
```
????X? H__PAGEZERO?__TEXT@@__text__TEXT0?X0??__stubs__TEXT????__stub_helper__TEXT?????__cstring__TEXT????__unwind_info__TEXT??H???__DATA_CONST@@@@__got__DATA_CONST@?__DATA?@?@__la_symbol_ptr__DATA?__data__DA?H__LINKEDIT?@?"?? ?0?0h???H

                                                                    8d
                                                                      /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib&`)h?UH??H???E??E??E??}?d??E???

```

Because its a binary file, most of the bytes are not actually printable ASCII characters, you can use `hexdump` to see the byte's values:

`hexdump -C foo`

```

`addl` meand `add`, `jmp` means jump and so forth. This is not important for now, the point is that `gcc` which is a popular C compiler, will take your code and make it into machine code.

Lets have another example:


FizzBuzz

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (i % 15 == 0) {
            printf("fizzbuzz\n");
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("buzz\n");
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            printf("fizz\n");
        } else {
            printf("%d\n",i);
        }
    }
}
```

What is your name?

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char input[20] = {0};
    while(1) {
        printf("What is your name: ");
        scanf("%s",input);
        printf("\nHello %s\n",input);
    }
}
```

You see how we say `char input[20]` which means we habe 20 elements of type `char` pointed by the input variable, it is literally just a pointer to some memory, and we can use `input[1]` to go to the address `input` plus 1 byte. Same with `int x[10]`, if we do x[3], it will go to the address pointed by `x` and add 3 * 4 to it.

We can make interesting bugs like that, because nobody will check if we go and read somewhere outside of the defined array:


```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char input[20] = {0};
    int b = 5;
    while(1) {
        printf("What is your name: ");
        scanf("%s",input);
        printf("\nHello %s\n",input);

        for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
            printf("  %d -> %d -> %c\n", i, input[i],input[i]);
        }
    }
}

```

You will see some garbage from element 20 to 39, because it will actually go and read beyond the input bounderioes.


## [DAY-137] For; File; If

Play with [words.txt](words.txt)

Open the file and print all the lines:

```
f = open("words.txt")
for line in f:
    print(line)
```

Remove the newline:

```
f = open("words.txt")
for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    print(word)
```

Print only words with more than 10 characters:

```
f = open("words.txt")
for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    if len(word) > 10:
        print(word)
```

Print only words starting with 'ab':

```
f = open("words.txt")
for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    if word[0] == 'a' and word[1] == 'b':
        print(word)
```

Print words not containing a character

```
f = open("words.txt")
for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    if 'e' not in word:
        print(word)
```

Avoid words containing multiple characters

```
f = open("words.txt")
def avoid(word, characters):
    for c in characters:
        for w in word:
            if w == c:
                return False
    return True

for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    if avoid(word, ['a','b','c']):
        print(word)
```

Another implementation using 'char' in 'string':

```
f = open("words.txt")

def avoid(word, characters):
    for c in characters:
        for c in word:
            return False
    return True

for line in f:
    word = line.strip()
    if avoid(word, ['a','b','c']):
        print(word)
```

Take it easy.

Count how many lines have exactly 5 characters

    if len(w) == 5:
        n += 1

```

How many words have 7 and how many 5 characters?

```
fi = open('words.txt')
n = 0
x = 0
for line in fi:
    w = line.strip()
    if len(w) == 5:
        n += 1
    if len(w) == 7:

## [DAY-141] Wiki; API

Today we are going to make a small app that uses wikipedia. First install the wikipedia package:
```
pip3 install wikipedia
```

```
import wikipedia as wiki

while True:
    what = input("search> ")
    summary = wiki.summary(what)
    print(summary)
    print('*' * 40)
```

Will search wikipeadia the string you input, like this:

```
search> leonadro da vinci
Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of...
[...]
search>
```

Lets do the same but with pygame:

![game-141.png](./screenshots/game-141.png "game 141 screenshot")

```
import wikipedia as wiki
import pgzrun

HEIGHT = 800
WIDTH = 800
text = ''
info = ''
def on_key_down(key, mod, unicode):
    global text, info
    if key == keys.BACKSPACE:
        if len(text) > 0:
            text = text[:-1]
    elif key == keys.RETURN:
        info = wiki.summary(text)
        text = ''

    elif len(unicode) > 0 and ord(unicode) >= 32 and ord(unicode) <= 126:
        text += unicode


def draw():
    screen.clear()
    screen.draw.text(info, (10,10), fontsize=18,fontname="437-win", width=WIDTH-20)
    screen.draw.text(text, (WIDTH/2,HEIGHT - 40), color=(255,0,0), fontsize=30,fontname="437-win")

pgzrun.go()
```

What does this do actually? How does the wikipedia module work? First thing you want to check is the documentation page, https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/ and then you can also check the source code: https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia

Next you would like to think, how would this python module download the data from wikipedia.

What it actually does, is it opens a web page, just a page that is specifically made to be easier to be read with programs, try to open: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&explaintext=&titles=Dog which will be the page for `Dog`, you will see:

```
{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"4269567":{"pageid":4269567,"ns":0,"title":"Dog","extract":"The dog or domestic dog
[...]
an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first carnivoran...
[...]
Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldnes
[...]
```

You can see the equivalent HTML page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog, The other page, which had structured data easier to read by python and any other programming language, is called API, Application Proggramming Interface. It just means that someone thought explicitly that their output will be read by programs and not people, and so they designed the interface that way. In the wikipedia example they return JSON.

JSON is data serialization format, its goal is to make it easy for programs to exchange data, for example I can have an array, or dictionary, and I want to make it easy for some other program to read it, so I use JSON to make it into text with special rules, and they can use their JSON decoder to make it into data.

```
>>> import json
>>> a = {"a":"b","c":3}
>>>
>>> print(json.dumps([1,2,a]))
[1, 2, {"a": "b", "c": 3}]
>>>
>>> d = json.loads('[1, 2, {"a": "b", "c": 3}]')
>>> d
[1, 2, {'a': 'b', 'c': 3}]
```


You see how it looks similar to the wikipedia API output, we will go in depth in the JSON format some times later, the point now is to just recognize that there is a whole world of APIs that are gluing the programs on your computer, and even the internet together so they can communicate. JSON is one of the most common serialization protocol, but there are many many more.
