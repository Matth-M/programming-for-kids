> can you fly with an umbrella

In theory, it is possible to fly with an
umbrella, but it would depend on a
variety of factors such as the size and
weight of the umbrella, the strength of
the wind, and the individual's weight
and strength. However, it is not
recommended to try to fly with an
umbrella as it could be dangerous and
potentially lead to injury.
